# project-monthly-billing
This is the beginning of a project to keep track of my monthly billing. I have been manually tracking my monthly bills using an excel sheet. This has been an okay process for me, but I needed something better. There are many monthly expense software and websites out there, but none of the solutions really had what I was looking for. I didn't want something that paid bills for me, but rather something I could add bills and payment methods and update manually myself. Some bills are paid directly to someone else and not a company and just need to be marked as manully paid. I want to get email/text alerts when I had bills upcoming, and the day they are due to make sure they get paid. I have decided to create my own solution for my own needs.
